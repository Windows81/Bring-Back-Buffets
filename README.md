As of 2022-07-06, I have no intention to bring this project back to the limelight.  I designed Bring Back Buffets to address buffet closures dring Covid closures in early 2021.  This was before vaccines were available.  Though the codebase was complete enough to work in a pro*dev*ction environment, I was not successful in advertising to buffet owners.

## Let's *Bring Buffets Back to Business* with an in-house mobile ordering solution!
1.	Customer(s) request a table and pay up-front.
2.	Cashier hands receipt to customers(s) with an order code and table number.
3.	Customer(s) place their buffet orders on their mobile devices.
4.	A server will make the requested order and bring it to the table.
